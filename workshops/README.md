## üöÄ Getting Started

### Environment Setup

Most workshops use Jupyter notebooks. Setup options:

#### Option 1: Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab (Recommended)
```bash
# Free, no AWS account needed for notebooks
# Visit: https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws
# Clone this repository
# Run notebooks directly
```

#### Option 2: Amazon SageMaker Studio
```bash
# Requires AWS account
# Create SageMaker Domain
# Launch JupyterLab
# Clone repository
```

#### Option 3: Local Development
```bash
# Navigate to workshop directory
cd claude-3.7-extended-thinking

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter lab

# Open notebooks and start learning
```

## üí° Workshop Completion Tips

### Time Management
- **Block dedicated time**: Workshops are most effective with focused sessions
- **Take breaks**: Step away between complex lessons
- **Practice immediately**: Apply learnings to real problems
- **Review notebooks**: Code examples are reference material

### Active Learning
- Run all code cells yourself
- Experiment with parameters
- Try variations of prompts
- Compare results
- Take notes on insights

### Going Deeper
- Read referenced documentation
- Explore linked resources
- Join community discussions
- Build your own examples
- Share your learnings

## üéØ After Completing Workshops

### Apply Your Knowledge
1. **Start a project**: Use [Streamlit Applications](../streamlit-applications/) for rapid prototyping
2. **Build production apps**: Deploy with [CDK Applications](../cdk-applications/)
3. **Explore patterns**: Check [Deployment Examples](../deployment-examples/)
4. **Reference code**: Use [Code Samples](../code-samples/) as snippets

### Continue Learning
- **Claude API docs**: https://docs.anthropic.com/
- **AWS Bedrock docs**: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/
- **Anthropic Cookbook**: https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook
- **Our Cookbooks**: [../cookbooks/](../cookbooks/)

### Share and Contribute
- Write blog posts about your experience
- Create your own notebooks
- Contribute improvements
- Help others in discussions

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Jupyter Kernel Issues**
```bash
# Restart kernel
# Kernel ‚Üí Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs

# If persists, recreate environment
deactivate
rm -rf venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**AWS Credentials**
```bash
# Configure AWS CLI
aws configure

# Or set environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

**Bedrock Access**
```bash
# Ensure model access enabled in AWS Console:
# Bedrock ‚Üí Model access ‚Üí Request access
# Wait for approval (usually instant for Claude models)
```

**Python Dependencies**
```bash
# Update pip first
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install with verbose output
pip install -r requirements.txt --verbose

# If specific package fails, install separately
pip install package-name
```
