    "- **Supply Chain Optimization**: Determining warehouse locations, shipping routes, and inventory distribution\n",
    "- **Resource Allocation**: Allocating limited resources across competing projects or departments\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Start with a clear problem formulation**: Define variables, constraints, and objectives\n",
    "2. **Use extended thinking to analyze the problem structure**: Before diving into code\n",
    "3. **Begin with a feasible solution**: Even if sub-optimal, it provides a foundation\n",
    "4. **Iteratively improve**: Make incremental changes that respect constraints\n",
    "5. **Visualize intermediate results**: To gain insights and detect issues early\n",
    "6. **Balance competing constraints**: Recognize when perfect solutions aren't possible\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining algorithmic approaches with Claude's extended thinking capabilities, you can tackle increasingly complex problems that would be difficult to solve with either approach alone.\n",
