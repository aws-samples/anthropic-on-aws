    "## Understanding Tool Use with Extended Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude 3.7 Sonnet combines two powerful capabilities: extended thinking and tool use. When used together effectively, they create a workflow that mimics how humans approach complex tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extended Thinking**: Claude thinks through a problem step by step in a dedicated \"scratchpad\" space\n",
    "2. **Tool Use**: Claude requests and uses external tools to gather information or perform actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Sequential Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "When combining extended thinking with tool use, Claude follows a specific sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A single extended thinking block (scratchpad) per assistant turn\n",
    "2. A single assistant text response\n",
    "3. Followed by possible tool calls\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- You won't see interleaved extended thinking and tool calls\n",
    "- Extended thinking happens first, then tool calls follow\n",
    "- Tool use within extended thinking itself is not supported\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a visualization of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "[User Query] → [Extended Thinking] → [Assistant Response] → [Tool Calls] → [Tool Results] → [Next Turn]\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this like a person who:\n",
    "1. First thinks through a problem carefully\n",
    "2. Then explains their reasoning\n",
    "3. Finally takes action based on that reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is particularly effective for tasks that require both careful reasoning and access to external information or capabilities."

    "## Tool Use Utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses several utility functions from the `claude_utils.py` module to streamline working with Claude's tool use capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `define_tool`: Creates a tool specification with a name, description, and parameter schema\n",
    "- `handle_tool_call`: Processes tool calls and routes them to the appropriate handler functions\n",
    "- `calculate`, `get_weather`, `search_wikipedia`: Individual tool implementations\n",
    "- `get_common_tools`: Returns a dictionary of pre-configured common tools\n",
    "\n",
    "These utility functions allow us to focus on the core concepts of combining extended thinking with tool use, without getting lost in implementation details. You could adapt these utility functions for your own applications by adding new tools and handlers specific to your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, our example tools use simulated data rather than calling external APIs, but the pattern would be the same when connecting to real data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explore how Claude's extended thinking capability works with these tools."

    "## Conclusion: The Power of Combining Extended Thinking and Tool Use\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've explored how to effectively combine Claude 3.7 Sonnet's extended thinking capability with tool use. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Sequential Pattern**: Claude first reasons about the problem, then uses tools to gather information or perform actions\n",
    "2. **Multi-Step Workflows**: Complex problems can be solved through multiple steps of reasoning and tool use\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**: Robust research agents need strategies for handling errors and recovering from issues\n",
    "4. **Research Planning**: Extended thinking helps Claude develop systematic research plans that guide tool use\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination creates a powerful workflow that mimics how humans approach complex tasks:\n",
    "- First thinking through what information is needed\n",
    "- Then gathering that information through appropriate tools\n",
    "- Finally synthesizing the information into a comprehensive response\n",
    "\n",
    "As you build your own applications with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, consider how you can leverage this pattern to create more intelligent, adaptable, and useful AI assistants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To continue exploring extended thinking and tool use, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adding more specialized tools** tailored to your specific domain\n",
    "2. **Implementing more sophisticated error handling** strategies\n",
    "3. **Experimenting with different reasoning budgets** for different types of tasks\n",
    "4. **Building more complex multi-step workflows** for specific use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of extended thinking and tool use opens up a wide range of possibilities for creating AI assistants that can tackle complex real-world problems."
