    "1. **Focus Questions** direct Claude's attention to specific aspects of the problem that you consider most important. This is useful when you want deep analysis of particular dimensions.\n",

    "1. **Consistency**: Each template encapsulates best practices for a particular type of task\n",
    "2. **Reusability**: Templates can be reused across different problems of the same type\n",

    "4. **Team alignment**: Templates help teams adopt consistent approaches to similar problems\n",
    "\n",
    "When building your template library, focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose-specific templates**: Create templates for specific types of tasks rather than generic ones\n",
    "- **Clear variable names**: Use descriptive names for placeholders to make templates easier to use\n",
    "- **Thoughtful structure**: Design templates that guide Claude's reasoning without constraining it\n",

    "## Summary: Effective Prompting Techniques for Extended Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've explored several powerful techniques for crafting prompts that get the most out of Claude 3.7 Sonnet's extended thinking capability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **General vs. Step-by-Step Instructions**\n",
    "   - General instructions typically work better with extended thinking\n",
    "   - Allow Claude to determine its own reasoning path while providing broad guidance\n",
    "   - Find a balance that provides structure without over-constraining the thinking process\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **N-shot Prompting with Extended Thinking**\n",
    "   - Provide examples of reasoning patterns using tags like `<thinking>`\n",
    "   - Guide the style of reasoning without constraining the content\n",
    "   - Use realistic examples that match the complexity of your target problem\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Controlling Reasoning Depth and Scope**\n",
    "   - Use focus questions to direct attention to specific aspects\n",
    "   - Specify constraints to ground the analysis in practical realities\n",
    "   - Apply frameworks to structure the reasoning process\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating Reusable Prompt Templates**\n",
    "   - Develop purpose-specific templates for different types of tasks\n",
    "   - Include variables to customize prompts for specific scenarios\n",
    "   - Track performance to continuously improve your templates\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these techniques, you can craft prompts that leverage Claude's extended thinking capabilities to their fullest potential, resulting in more thorough, insightful, and valuable responses."

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand how to craft effective prompts for extended thinking, you might want to explore:\n",

    "1. **Tool Use Integration**: Combining extended thinking with tool calling (covered in Lesson 5)\n",
    "2. **Long-Form Content Generation**: Using extended thinking to generate comprehensive content (Lesson 6)\n",
    "3. **Complex Problem-Solving**: Applying extended thinking to tackle challenging problems in various domains (Lesson 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "To reinforce what you've learned, try these exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a general instruction prompt for a complex problem in your domain\n",
    "2. Develop an N-shot prompt with examples relevant to your use case\n",
    "3. Create a reusable template for a common task you perform\n",
    "4. Compare the results of different prompting techniques on the same problem\n",
