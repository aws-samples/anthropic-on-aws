    "## 1. Overview of Claude 3.7 Sonnet's Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude 3.7 Sonnet represents Anthropic's most advanced model to date, released in February 2025. It introduces several key improvements over previous Claude models:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hybrid Reasoning Approach**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet can operate in both standard mode and \"extended thinking\" mode, allowing you to control when the model engages in deeper reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increased Output Length**: Supports up to 64K output tokens (8x longer than previous models), with up to 128K tokens in preview.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Computer Use**: Improved capabilities for computer interaction, including additional actions like scroll, wait, left mouse down/up, hold key, and triple click.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Code Generation**: Leading performance on coding benchmarks, particularly with SWE-bench Verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reasoning Budget Control**: When using the API, you can control exactly how much \"thinking power\" to allocate to a task, from the minimum required budget to much larger allocations for complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude 3.7 Sonnet excels at tasks requiring deep analysis, complex problem-solving, and multi-step reasoning - while maintaining the ability to provide quick responses when extended thinking isn't needed."

    "## 2. Understanding Extended Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Extended Thinking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Extended thinking is a groundbreaking capability that allows Claude to solve complex problems through step-by-step reasoning that is visible to the user. Think of it like watching a mathematician work through a proof on a whiteboard, rather than just seeing the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Extended Thinking Works\n",
    "\n",
    "When enabled, Claude 3.7 Sonnet follows a process similar to human problem-solving:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It first processes the task in an internal \"scratchpad\" - thinking through the problem step by step\n",
    "2. This reasoning process is visible to you in the API response\n",
    "3. After completing its reasoning, Claude provides a final answer informed by this thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extended Thinking vs. Chain of Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Chain of Thought (CoT):**\n",
    "- Requires specific prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning\n",
    "- The reasoning quality depends heavily on prompt engineering\n",
    "- Reasoning and response are intermingled\n",
    "- No control over reasoning depth\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extended Thinking:**\n",
    "- Explicitly enabled via API parameter\n",
    "- Reasoning budget can be precisely controlled\n",
    "- Reasoning appears in a separate field from the final response\n",
    "- More thorough and structured reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasoning Budget\n",
    "\n",
    "A key innovation of Claude 3.7 Sonnet is the ability to control the \"reasoning budget\" - the amount of tokens allocated to the thinking process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minimum budget: 1,024 tokens\n",
    "- Can be increased up to the model's 128K token limit\n",
    "- Larger budgets allow for more thorough reasoning on complex problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the reasoning budget like allocating CPU time to a computational task - more complex tasks benefit from larger allocations."

    "## 6. When to Use Extended Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our experiments and performance analysis, we can draw some conclusions about when to use extended thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best use cases for extended thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex reasoning tasks**: Math problems, logic puzzles, and multi-step reasoning benefit significantly from extended thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Problems requiring exhaustive analysis**: When Claude needs to consider many possibilities or edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **When accuracy is critical**: Extended thinking generally improves accuracy on challenging problems by reducing the chance of reasoning errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transparency requirements**: When you need to see Claude's reasoning process to verify its approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When standard mode might be sufficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple factual queries**: For straightforward questions like \"What is the capital of France?\", extended thinking adds cost without significant benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creative tasks**: Creative writing, summarization, and other content generation tasks may not benefit as much from extended thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time-sensitive applications**: If response speed is critical, standard mode provides faster responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cost-sensitive applications**: Extended thinking increases token usage and therefore cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the right reasoning budget:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal reasoning budget depends on the complexity of your task:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple reasoning tasks**: 1,024-2,048 tokens\n",
    "- **Moderate complexity**: 2,048-4,096 tokens\n",
    "- **Complex problems**: 4,096-8,192 tokens\n",
    "- **Very complex problems**: 8,192+ tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "As we observed in our performance analysis, there's often a \"sweet spot\" where:\n",
    "- Too small a budget may not give Claude enough space to solve complex problems\n",
    "- Beyond a certain point, larger budgets show diminishing returns while increasing cost and latency\n",
    "- The efficiency (tokens per second) tends to peak at moderate budget sizes before declining\n",
    "\n",
    "Our performance charts demonstrate this tradeoff visually, helping you determine the optimal budget for your specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll explore a more systematic framework for determining when to use extended thinking and how to optimize the reasoning budget for different task types."
