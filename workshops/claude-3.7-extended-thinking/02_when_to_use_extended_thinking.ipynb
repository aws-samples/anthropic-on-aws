    "### Understanding the Task Complexity Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The `classify_task_complexity` function is an efficient way to automatically categorize the complexity of user prompts. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Leveraging a smaller model**: We use **Claude 3.5 Haiku** instead of Claude 3.7 Sonnet for this classification step because it's faster and more cost-effective for this simple decision task.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Classification framework**: The function sends the prompt to Claude with explicit instructions defining four complexity categories (simple, medium, complex, very_complex) along with examples of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency considerations**: The function is optimized for speed and cost by:\n",
    "   - Using a smaller model **(Claude Haiku 3.5)**\n",
    "   - Setting temperature to 0 for deterministic responses\n",
    "   - Limiting the output to just 10 tokens\n",
    "   - Requesting only the category name\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Practical application**: Think of this as the \"triage\" step in our workflow - similar to how a CPU scheduler determines how much processing time to allocate to different tasks. This initial assessment helps us allocate the appropriate \"thinking resources\" to the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach creates a \"thinking pipeline\" where we efficiently allocate Claude's reasoning capabilities based on task demands - using the right tool for each stage of the process."

    "## Conclusion: A Framework for Effective Use of Extended Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "We've developed a systematic framework for determining when to use Claude's extended thinking capability and how to optimize its use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classify task complexity** using our automated classifier\n",
    "2. **Apply our decision tree** to determine if extended thinking is needed\n",
    "3. **Allocate appropriate reasoning budget** based on complexity\n",
    "4. **Monitor performance metrics** to continuously refine the approach\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this framework, you can:\n",
    "- Improve response quality for complex tasks\n",
    "- Avoid unnecessary costs for simple tasks\n",
    "- Balance performance and cost considerations\n",
    "- Adapt the approach based on your specific requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll explore how to optimize reasoning budget allocation in more detail, building on the foundation established here."
