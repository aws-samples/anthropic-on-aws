def create_itinerary(days: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Creates a travel itinerary document based on the provided days data.

    Note: This is a dummy function that doesn't actually create a document.
    In a real implementation, this would format the itinerary data into a document.

    Args:
        days: A collection of day itinerary objects. The structure of each day
            object is not specified in this dummy implementation, but would typically
            contain activities, accommodations, transportation details, etc.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing:
            - status (str): "success" if the operation completed
            - message (str): A confirmation message
            - days (int): The number of days in the itinerary

    Examples:
        >>> day1 = {"activities": ["Visit Tokyo Tower", "Lunch at Tsukiji"]}
        >>> day2 = {"activities": ["Day trip to Kamakura", "Dinner in Yokohama"]}
        >>> create_itinerary([day1, day2])
        {"status": "success", "message": "Itinerary created successfully", "days": 2}
    """
    # This would normally format the itinerary data into a document
    # For this example, we'll just return confirmation
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "message": "Itinerary created successfully",
        "days": len(days),
