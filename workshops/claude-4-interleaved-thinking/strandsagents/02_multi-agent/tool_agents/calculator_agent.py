    """Specialized agent for performing mathematical calculations accurately.
    
    Creates and invokes a specialized calculator agent that uses the calculator tool
    to evaluate mathematical expressions. The agent provides explanation for complex
    calculations and handles various mathematical notations.
    
    Args:
        expression: A mathematical problem or expression to solve. Can include basic 
            arithmetic operations, complex formulas, or word problems requiring calculation.
    
    Returns:
        The calculated result with step-by-step explanation when appropriate.
        In error cases, returns an error message prefixed with "Error in calculator agent:".
    
    Examples:
        >>> calculator_agent("2 + 2")
        "4"
        >>> calculator_agent("What is 15% of 200?")
