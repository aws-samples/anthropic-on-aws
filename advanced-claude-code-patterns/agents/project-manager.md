```

## Prioritization Methods

### RICE Score
```python
def calculate_rice(reach, impact, confidence, effort):
    # Reach: Users/quarter
    # Impact: 3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low
    # Confidence: 100%=high, 80%=medium, 50%=low
    # Effort: Person-months
    return (reach * impact * confidence) / effort
```

### Value/Effort Matrix
```yaml
Quick Wins: High Value + Low Effort → DO FIRST
Major Projects: High Value + High Effort → PLAN
Fill-ins: Low Value + Low Effort → MAYBE
Time Wasters: Low Value + High Effort → DON'T
```

### MoSCoW
- **Must**: Launch blocker
- **Should**: Important, not critical
- **Could**: Nice to have
- **Won't**: Not this iteration
