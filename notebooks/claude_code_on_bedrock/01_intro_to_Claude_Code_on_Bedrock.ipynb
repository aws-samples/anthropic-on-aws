    "- **Maintains Coherence**: Unlike `/clear`, preserves the important parts of your conversation history\n",
    "- **Enhances Temporal Coherence**: Helps Claude better understand the timeline and sequence of your interactions\n",
    "- **Improves Context Referencing**: Makes it easier for Claude to accurately reference and recall information from earlier in the conversation\n",
    "- **Reduces Token Usage**: Significantly lowers the number of tokens consumed, helping manage costs\n",
    "- **Improves Performance**: With less context to process, Claude can respond more quickly\n",
    "- **Extends Conversation Length**: Allows you to have longer, more productive sessions without hitting context limits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Caching and /compact:\n",
    "- **With Prompt Caching**: When prompt caching is enabled in Bedrock, the cost benefits of `/compact` are less significant since you're not charged for repeated prompts\n",
    "- **Primary Benefit Shift**: With prompt caching, `/compact` becomes more valuable for maintaining conversation coherence rather than cost management\n",
    "- **Anthropic vs. Bedrock**: While Anthropic's Claude services and Bedrock's Claude implementation both offer prompt caching, they operate independently with different activation methods\n",
    "- **Still Recommended**: Even with prompt caching enabled, using `/compact` regularly helps Claude maintain a clearer understanding of your conversation flow and project context\n",

    "- After completing a major task or milestone\n",
    "- When you notice Claude's responses slowing down\n",
    "- Before starting a new, related subtask\n",
    "- When Claude seems to be confusing the order of past events or instructions\n",
