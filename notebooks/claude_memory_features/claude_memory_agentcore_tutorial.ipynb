    "## Building the Memory Tool Handler\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our basic connection set up, we need to create a function that handles Claude's memory tool requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Memory Tool?\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude Sonnet 4.5 has built-in memory capabilities - it can autonomously decide to **store**, **read**, and **update** information about you. When Claude wants to use memory, it sends tool requests to your application with commands like:\n",
    "- `view` - Read existing memories\n",
    "- `create` - Store new memories\n",
    "- `str_replace` - Update existing memories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need a Handler?\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude doesn't directly manage the memory - instead, it makes tool requests that we need to implement. Think of it like this:\n",
    "- **Claude (the brain)**: \"I want to remember that this user loves Python\"\n",
    "- **Our handler (the hands)**: Writes that information into AgentCore Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `handle_memory_tool()` function translates Claude's requests into AgentCore Memory operations:\n",
    "1. **List memories**: When Claude asks to `view /memories`, we return all the events stored in the memory.\n",
    "2. **Read a memory**: When Claude asks for a specific memory file (e.g., `/memories/user_profile.md`), we find the relevant memory and return its contents\n",
    "3. **Create memory**: When Claude wants to remember something new, we create a new event in AgentCore Memory and store the information specified by Claude\n",
    "4. **Update memory**: When Claude wants to update existing information, we create a new event with the same name with the modified content and we remove the old event.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Claude will use `.md` name extensions directly thanks to a system prompt we'll configure later in the chat function. This means our handler can use paths exactly as Claude provides them - no conversion needed! While this is not necessary for the AgentCore Memory implementation we keep this convention as it might help Claude define about the memory format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first create the memory:"

    "## Creating the Chat Function with Tool Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have a handler for memory operations, but we need a way to actually **talk to Claude** and handle its tool requests automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Not Just Call the API Directly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude's memory system uses a **tool use loop**. Here's what happens:\n",
    "1. You send a message to Claude\n",
    "2. Claude might respond with text OR with a tool use request (to access memory)\n",
    "3. If it requests a tool, you call `handle_memory_tool()` and send the result back\n",
    "4. Claude might then request MORE tools, or finally respond with text\n",
    "5. Repeat until Claude gives a final text response\n",
    "\n",
    "This back-and-forth needs to happen automatically - you don't want to manually check for tool requests each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Does chat_with_claude() Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `chat_with_claude()` function handles this entire loop:\n",
    "- **Manages conversation history**: Keeps track of all messages (yours and Claude's)\n",
    "- **Detects tool requests**: Automatically checks if Claude wants to use the memory tool\n",
    "- **Calls our handler**: Routes tool requests to `handle_memory_tool()`\n",
    "- **Loops until complete**: Keeps going until Claude gives a final text response\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Prompt Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure Claude uses `.md` file extensions (instead of defaulting to `.txt`), we'll configure a system prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "SYSTEM_PROMPT = \"When using the memory tool, always use .md file extensions for markdown-formatted memories.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use `.md` extensions?**\n",
    "- Markdown files render nicely in editors and GitHub\n",
    "- Supports formatting like **bold**, *italics*, lists, code blocks\n",
    "- Better readability for human review\n",
    "\n",
    "This system prompt will be included in every API call to Claude, ensuring consistent `.md` usage throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Tool Use Loop in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "You: \"Remember that I love Python\"\n",
    "  ‚Üí Claude: [tool_use: create memory about Python preference]\n",
    "    ‚Üí Handler: Creates { \"name\":\"user_preferences.md\", \"text\":...} event\n",
    "    ‚Üí [tool_result: success]\n",

      "1. **Interactive visualizations** - Perfect for exploring ML model results, feature distributions, and performance metrics\n",
      "2. **Integrates seamlessly** with pandas DataFrames and numpy arrays (your existing stack)\n",
      "3. **ML-specific features**:\n",
      "   - Confusion matrices\n",
      "   - ROC curves and AUC visualization\n",
      "   - Feature importance plots\n",
      "   - Dimensionality reduction visualizations (t-SNE, PCA)\n",
      "4. **Works great in VSCode** - Renders beautifully in Jupyter notebooks and VSCode's notebook interface\n",
      "5. **Dark theme support** - Has built-in dark templates that match your preference\n",
      "\n",
      "### Quick Example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import plotly.express as px\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "\n",
      "# Simple scatter plot from a DataFrame\n",

      "fig.show()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alternatives to consider:\n",
      "- **Seaborn** - If you prefer static, publication-ready plots with great defaults\n",
      "- **Altair** - If you like declarative visualization syntax\n",
      "- **Bokeh** - Another excellent interactive option with similar capabilities\n",
