# Getting Started with Claude's Memory and Context Management: Build Your First Multi-User Workflow

**What you'll learn**: By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working multi-user workflow where different team members share knowledge with Claude through persistent memory while automatically managing context to control costs, and you'll be ready to build your own production agentic workflows.

**Time required**: 60 minutes
**Prerequisites**:
- Python 3.8 or later installed
- AWS account with Bedrock access
- Basic familiarity with command line
- No prior AI or agent experience needed!

## What You'll Build

You'll simulate a multi-user sales workflow where different team members collaborate with Claude through shared memory:
- **Alice (Discovery)**: Provides customer requirements that Claude stores in memory
- **John (Solution Architect)**: Asks Claude to design solutions based on stored requirements
- **Sam (Proposal Writer)**: Asks Claude to create proposals using all stored information

Each person works in a separate chat context, but Claude remembers everything through persistent memory files. As conversations grow, Claude will automatically clear old technical overhead while keeping all the important information safe.

This simulates real production patterns - team members collaborating through a shared AI assistant.

### Why This Tutorial Matters

Multi-user AI workflows are powerful but traditionally have a fatal flaw: as different users interact and information accumulates, the context (conversation history) grows exponentially, leading to:
- Skyrocketing API costs (every token costs money)
- Hitting context limits and losing the conversation
- Slower responses as context grows

Claude Sonnet 4.5's Memory and Context Management features solve this problem. You'll see exactly how by the end of this tutorial.

## Before We Start

### Install the Tools

First, let's get everything you need installed.

**1. Clone or download the demo application:**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Projects
git clone <repository-url> streamlit_demo
cd streamlit_demo
```

**2. Create a Python virtual environment:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

**3. Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install streamlit boto3
```

**Checkpoint**: You should see installation messages ending with "Successfully installed streamlit-X.X.X boto3-X.X.X". If you see errors about permissions, try using `pip install --user` instead.

### Configure AWS Bedrock Credentials

Claude Sonnet 4.5 runs on AWS Bedrock. Let's set up your credentials.

**1. Configure AWS credentials:**

```bash
aws configure
```

You'll be prompted for:
- **AWS Access Key ID**: Get this from your AWS IAM console
- **AWS Secret Access Key**: Get this from your AWS IAM console
- **Default region name**: Enter `us-east-1`
- **Default output format**: Press Enter (leave default)

**2. Verify Bedrock access:**

```bash
aws bedrock list-foundation-models --region us-east-1 | grep claude-sonnet-4-5
```

**Expected output**: You should see model information containing "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"

**Checkpoint**: If you see the model listed, you're all set! If not, check that your AWS account has Bedrock access enabled in the us-east-1 region.

### Launch the Streamlit App

Now let's start the application!

**1. Launch Streamlit:**

```bash
streamlit run dual_chat_streamlit.py
```

**Expected output**:
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
Local URL: http://localhost:8501
```

**2. Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

**Checkpoint**: You should see a beautiful interface titled "D√©j√† Vu by Claude" with one chat window. If you see an error about AWS credentials, go back to the configuration step.

### Verify It's Working

Let's make sure everything is connected properly.

**1. In the chat window, type:**
```
Hello! Can you hear me?
```

**2. Press Enter**

**Expected result**: Claude should respond with a greeting. This means your AWS connection is working and Claude is responding!

**Checkpoint**: If you got a response, congratulations! Everything is set up correctly. If you see an error, check:
- Is your virtual environment activated? (You should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt)
- Are your AWS credentials configured correctly?
- Is the Streamlit server still running?

---

## Part 1: Understanding Memory (15 minutes)

Now that everything is working, let's learn about Claude's memory system by creating your first agent interaction.

### What is Memory?

Think of memory as a filing cabinet that Claude can access anytime. When Claude learns something important, it can:
- **Create** a new file to store information
- **Read** files to remember what it learned before
- **Update** files as information changes
- **Delete** files when no longer needed

The key insight: These files persist forever, independent of any single conversation. This means different users (via different chat contexts) can share knowledge!

### Create Your First Memory File

Let's watch Claude create a memory file for a customer.

**1. Look at your Streamlit interface** - you should see "Chat Context 1" with a system prompt already filled in. This tells Claude to store information in memory.

**2. Copy and paste this into Chat Context 1:**

```
I'm Alice from TechCorp. We need help with a cloud migration project for ACME Corp.
```

**3. Press Enter and watch carefully!**

**What to watch for**: As Claude responds, you'll see golden-colored boxes appear with "üîß Memory Tool" badges. These show Claude using its memory system!

**What just happened**: Claude recognized that you introduced yourself and mentioned a project. It decided this information is important enough to remember long-term, so it:
1. Called the memory tool with the `create` command
2. Created a file (probably named something like `memory_alice.md`)
3. Stored your information in a structured format

**Why this matters**: This memory file now exists outside this conversation. Other users (via other chat contexts) can read it, and even if your context gets cleared (which we'll see later), this information is safe.

### Verify Memory File Creation

Let's confirm the memory file was actually created.

**1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page**

**2. Find and expand the section titled "üìÅ Memory Files"**

**3. Look for a file** - you should see at least one file listed, something like:
```
memory_alice.md
X bytes ‚Ä¢ Modified [timestamp]
```

**4. Click the eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è)** next to the file

**Expected result**: You should see the file content in an editor, containing structured information about Alice and TechCorp's cloud migration project.

**Checkpoint**: If you see the memory file with Alice's information, perfect! You've just witnessed Claude's memory system in action. If not, try asking Claude explicitly: "Please save this information to memory."

### Add More Context

Let's give Claude more information to store.

**1. In Chat Context 1, type:**

```
Here are the requirements:

- Budget: $500K
- Timeline: 9 months
- Need to migrate 50 applications
- Must maintain SOC 2 compliance
- Team has limited cloud expertise

Please update my memory with these details.
```

**2. Press Enter and watch**

**What to watch for**: You'll see another "üîß Memory Tool" box appear, but this time the command will be `str_replace` (string replace) instead of `create`. This means Claude is **updating** an existing memory file rather than creating a new one.

**What just happened**: Claude:
1. Read the existing memory file to see what was already there
2. Found the right location to add the new information
3. Updated the file with the additional requirements

**3. Expand the tool result** (click the expander if it's collapsed)

**Expected result**: You should see JSON showing:
- `"operation": "str_replace"`
- `"replacements_made": 1` (or similar)
- A preview of the updated content

**Checkpoint**: Refresh the memory files section and click the eye icon again. The file should now contain all the new requirements you just provided.

### Understanding Memory Structure

**1. Look at the memory file content** (should still be open in the viewer)

You'll notice Claude organizes information in a structured way:
```markdown
# Alice - TechCorp Cloud Migration Project

## Contact Information
- Name: Alice
- Company: TechCorp

## Project: ACME Corp Migration
- Budget: $500K
- Timeline: 9 months
...
```

**Why this structure matters**: Claude doesn't just dump text into files. It creates well-organized, readable markdown that makes it easy to:
- Find specific information quickly
- Update portions without rewriting everything
- Share with other agents who need different pieces

**Key insight**: Memory files are designed for persistence and sharing, not just for the current conversation.

---

## Part 2: Multi-User Collaboration (20 minutes)

Now for the exciting part: simulating multiple users (Alice, John, Sam) sharing knowledge through memory!

### Set Up Additional User Contexts

Currently, you have one chat window. Let's add two more to simulate multiple team members.

**1. Click the "‚ûï Add New Chat" button** in the top right

**2. Click it again** to add a third chat

**Expected result**: You should now see three chat windows arranged on the screen:
- Chat Context 1
- Chat Context 2
- Chat Context 3

**3. Verify the system prompt:**

All three chats should have the **same system prompt** (this is the default):
```
IMPORTANT: ALWAYS VIEW YOUR MEMORY DIRECTORY BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE.
MEMORY PROTOCOL:
1. Store all memories in .md format at /home/claude/memories/
2. Use the `view` command of your `memory` tool to check for earlier progress.
3. Use memory_{topic}.md format to store general memories based on their topic
4. As you make progress, record status / progress / thoughts in your memory.
ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context window might be reset at any moment, so you risk losing any progress that is not recorded in your memory directory.
```

**Why use the same system prompt?**
- Simpler setup for beginners
- User roles are defined by the user messages, not system prompts
- Still demonstrates multi-agent coordination through memory
- Closer to how you'd use Claude in production (single model, different instructions)

**Checkpoint**: You should now have three chat windows with identical system prompts. Don't worry - they'll behave differently based on what you ask them to do!

### User 2 (John): Read Memory and Design Solution

Now let's see the magic of cross-user coordination. John will ask Claude to design a solution based on what Alice stored.

**1. In Chat Context 2, type:**

```
Hi, I'm John from TechCorp. Based on the customer information you have in memory about Alice and ACME Corp, please design a cloud migration architecture that addresses their requirements.
```

**2. Press Enter and watch the token counter at the bottom**

**What to watch for**:
- First, you'll see a "üîß Memory Tool" box with command: `view` - Claude is reading the memory files!
- Then Claude will design a solution based on what it read
- Another "üîß Memory Tool" box may appear with command: `create` - Claude storing its architecture decisions
- Look at the bottom: "üìä Input: X tokens | Output: Y tokens"

**What just happened**: John (using Chat Context 2):
1. Asked Claude to design a solution
2. Claude read the memory file that Alice created in Chat Context 1
3. Claude understood Alice's requirements without John repeating them
4. Claude designed a solution and stored it in memory

**This is multi-user collaboration!** John never saw Alice's conversation, but Claude knows everything because all chats share the same memory system. John defined his role (architect) through his user message.

**3. Look at the response**

**Expected result**: You should see Claude reference specific details from Alice's requirements (like budget, timeline, compliance needs) even though you never mentioned them in Chat Context 2. It read them from memory!

**Checkpoint**: If you see Claude designing a solution that references Alice's specific requirements (budget, timeline, SOC 2 compliance), you've successfully demonstrated cross-agent memory sharing! If Claude says it doesn't know about Alice, try prompting: "Please check the memory files for customer information."

### User 3 (Sam): Build on Shared Knowledge

Let's bring in the third team member to complete the workflow. Sam will ask Claude to write a proposal.

**1. In Chat Context 3, type:**

```
Hi, I'm Sam from TechCorp. Please create a compelling proposal for ACME Corp based on the customer requirements and solution architecture you have in memory.
```

**2. Press Enter and watch**

**What to watch for**:
- Multiple memory `view` operations - Sam (Chat 3) asking Claude to read files from BOTH previous users
- Claude weaving together information from different sources
- Possibly creating another memory file to store the proposal

**What just happened**: Sam (using Chat Context 3):
1. Asked Claude to create a proposal
2. Claude read Alice's memory file (customer requirements)
3. Claude read John's memory file (solution architecture)
4. Claude combined both pieces of information
5. Claude created a personalized proposal and stored it in memory

**3. Read the proposal response**

**Expected result**: The proposal should include:
- Specific details about ACME Corp's needs (from Alice's memory)
- Technical solution components (from John's memory)
- Personalized addressing of pain points

**This is a complete multi-user workflow!** Three different team members (Alice, John, Sam), each playing different roles, sharing knowledge seamlessly through Claude's memory.

**Checkpoint**: If you see a complete proposal that references both customer requirements AND solution architecture, congratulations! You've successfully simulated a multi-user workflow with shared memory.

### Verify the Complete Memory Picture

**1. Scroll to the "üìÅ Memory Files" section and expand it**

**Expected result**: You should now see **at least 2-3 memory files**:
- One about Alice/ACME Corp requirements
- One about the solution architecture
- Possibly one about the proposal

**2. Click the eye icon on each file** to see its contents

**What you're seeing**: The complete knowledge graph of your multi-user workflow. Each chat context contributed information that the others could read and build upon.

**This is the power of shared memory**: Instead of passing all context between users (expensive and limited), different chat contexts communicate through a shared, persistent filing system. The same Claude model helps different users based on their instructions.

## Part 3: Context Management in Action (20 minutes)

Now for the most important part: understanding how Claude keeps these conversations efficient as they grow.

### The Problem: Context Explosion

Before we trigger context management, let's understand the problem it solves.

**Think about what just happened:**
- Alice (Chat 1) provided info that Claude created and updated in memory files (multiple tool calls)
- John (Chat 2) asked Claude to read memory, design solution, and store it (more tool calls)
- Sam (Chat 3) asked Claude to read multiple memories and create a proposal (even more tool calls)

Each tool call generates:
- A request (the tool input)
- A response (the tool result)
- Both stay in the conversation history

**The problem**: In a traditional system, ALL of these tool calls would stay in the context forever. As you add more interactions:
- Context grows exponentially
- API costs skyrocket (you pay per token)
- You eventually hit the context limit and the conversation breaks

**The solution**: Context Management automatically identifies and clears old tool results that are no longer needed, while keeping memory files safe.

### Configure Context Management

Let's set up context management to trigger quickly so you can see it in action.

**1. Find and expand "‚öôÔ∏è Context Management Settings"** near the top of the page

**2. Make sure "Enable Context Management" is CHECKED** (it should be by default)

**3. Adjust the sliders:**
- **Trigger Threshold**: Move slider to **2,000 tokens**
  (This is lower than production but perfect for demos)
- **Keep Last N Tool Uses**: Set to **0**
  (This means clear everything old - maximum clearing)
- **Clear At Least (tokens)**: Set to **1,000**
  (Minimum amount to clear each time)

**Why these settings?**
- In production, you'd use 20,000-50,000 token trigger
- For learning, 2,000 lets you see clearing happen quickly
- These settings mean: "When input tokens exceed 2,000, clear old tool results"

**4. Read the info message** in that section - it explains why these settings differ from production

**Checkpoint**: You should see your settings displayed. Each time Claude responds now, you'll see a configuration line at the top showing these values.

### Watch Token Counts Accumulate

Let's add more interactions to build up token counts.

**1. Look at any of your previous chat responses**

At the bottom of each response, you should see a line like:
```
üìä Input: 2,948 tokens | Output: 549 tokens | ‚è≥ No clearing yet
```

This shows:
- **Input tokens**: All the context Claude read (system prompt + history)
- **Output tokens**: Claude's response
- **Status**: Whether clearing happened

**2. In Chat Context 1, type:**

```
Show me all the memories you have stored in the system.
```

**3. Press Enter and look at the token count**

**What to watch for**: The input token count should increase. This operation is particularly token-heavy because viewing memories returns their full content!

**4. Try this in Chat Context 2:**

```
What do you remember about Alice and the ACME Corp project?
```

**5. Watch the tokens continue to climb**

**6. If you haven't seen clearing yet, try in Chat Context 3:**

```
Summarize all the information we've gathered across all memory files.
```

### The Magic Moment: Context Clearing Triggers

**Keep adding memory-related queries** until you see:

**üéâ THE MOMENT YOU'RE WAITING FOR:**

```
üéâ Context Management Active! Cleared 8 old tool use(s) and saved 1,234 tokens.
```

(Your exact numbers will vary)

**What just happened**:
1. Claude's API detected that input tokens exceeded 2,000
2. It identified old tool use/result pairs that weren't needed anymore
3. It removed them from the context (replaced with placeholders)
4. It sent a reduced context to the API
5. Your conversation continued smoothly!

**The critical insight**: Notice that Claude still responded perfectly! Even though old tool results were cleared, all the important information is safe in memory files.

**Checkpoint**: If you see the success message about clearing, perfect! If not after 10-15 messages, try the "view all memories" query multiple times - that's particularly token-heavy.

### Verify Memory Files Survived

This is the most important verification in the entire tutorial.

**1. Scroll to the "üìÅ Memory Files" section**

**2. Check all your memory files**

**Expected result**: ALL memory files should still be there, unchanged:
- Alice's customer information - SAFE
- John's solution architecture - SAFE
- Sam's proposal - SAFE

**What this proves**: Context Management cleared the *intermediate scaffolding* (the JSON responses from tool calls) but preserved the *permanent knowledge* (memory files).

**This separation is the key to scalable multi-agent systems.**

**Checkpoint**: If all memory files are intact and you can still read them, you've verified the core promise of Context Management: clear overhead, preserve knowledge.

### Try Continuing the Conversation

Let's prove the system still works perfectly after clearing.

**1. In any chat window, type:**

```
What do you know about Alice's project?
```

**2. Watch Claude's response**

**Expected result**: Claude should read the memory file and give you complete information about Alice, the ACME Corp project, budget, timeline, etc.

**What this proves**: Even though we cleared old tool results, Claude can still access all stored information by reading memory files. Nothing important was lost!

**3. Try a more complex query:**

```
Can you compare the solution architecture to the original requirements and identify any gaps?
```

**Expected result**: Claude should read both relevant memory files and provide a detailed comparison.

**This is the breakthrough**: Context was cleared, tokens were saved, but the agents' cognitive ability is unchanged. They remember everything through persistent memory.

---

## Part 4: Understanding the Statistics (10 minutes)

Let's dive into the metrics to understand exactly what happened.

### Check the Statistics Dashboard

**1. Scroll down and expand "üìä Context Management Statistics"**

**2. Look at the metrics for each chat:**

You should see cards showing:
- **Times Cleared**: How many clearing operations happened
- **Tokens Saved**: Total tokens eliminated from context
- **Messages**: Total conversation turns
- **Last Cleared**: Timestamp of most recent clearing

**3. Look at the Overall Statistics** section below:

You'll see:
- **Total Context Clears**: Sum across all chats
- **Total Tokens Saved**: Aggregate savings
- **Avg Saved per Clear**: Efficiency metric

### Understand What the Numbers Mean

Let's interpret these statistics:

**Example numbers you might see:**
- Times Cleared: 1-3
- Tokens Saved: 1,000-5,000

**What this means**:
- Every time clearing triggered, ~1,000-2,000 tokens were removed
- Those tokens would have been sent with EVERY subsequent request
- Over 100 more messages, you'd save 100,000-200,000 tokens
- For high-volume applications, this is thousands of dollars saved

**Real-world scaling**:
- 1,000 conversations/day with 50 messages each = 50,000 daily API calls
- Without context management: Growing context, escalating costs
- With context management: Stable context, controlled costs
- **Annual savings for enterprise applications: $50K-$200K+**

### Calculate Your Efficiency Gains

Let's do some math on your actual results.

**1. Note your "Tokens Saved" number** - let's say it's 2,000

**2. Count how many messages you've sent** across all chats - let's say 15

**3. Calculate what would have happened without clearing:**
- Those 2,000 tokens would be in EVERY subsequent request
- If you had 50 messages instead of 15: 2,000 √ó 35 = 70,000 extra tokens!
- At Claude's pricing (~$3 per million input tokens): $0.21 saved
- Scale to 10,000 conversations: $2,100 saved

**4. Understand the exponential benefit:**
- The longer the conversation, the more you save
- Multi-agent systems multiply the benefit
- Production systems see 50-80% token reduction

**The key insight**: Context Management doesn't just save tokens on one request - it prevents exponential growth that would make long conversations impossible.

### Explore the Context Management Data

Want to see exactly what happened under the hood?

**1. Look for a recent response** where clearing happened

**2. Find the expandable section** labeled "üîç CM Data"

**3. Expand it**

**What you're seeing**: The actual response from Claude's API showing:
```json
{
  "applied_edits": [{
    "type": "clear_tool_uses_20250919",
    "cleared_tool_uses": 8,
    "cleared_input_tokens": 1234
  }]
}
```

This shows:
- **Type**: What kind of clearing operation (tool uses in this case)
- **Cleared tool uses**: How many tool call pairs were removed
- **Cleared input tokens**: Exact token savings

**This is full transparency** - you can see exactly what the system did.

---

## Part 5: Verification & Understanding (10 minutes)

Let's solidify your understanding by testing edge cases and exploring what you've learned.

### Test: Does Memory Really Persist?

Let's try something interesting: clear a chat's history but verify memory survives.

**1. Pick one of your chat windows** (let's say Chat Context 1)

**2. Click the "Clear Chat" button** at the bottom of that chat

**3. Verify the chat is empty** - all messages should be gone

**4. Now type in that same chat:**

```
What information do you have about Alice and ACME Corp?
```

**5. Press Enter**

**Expected result**: Claude should respond with complete information! Even though you cleared the chat history, it can read the memory file that Alice created in Chat 1.

**What this proves**:
- Memory files are truly independent of conversation context
- Clearing context (manually or automatically) doesn't affect memory
- Chat contexts can be restarted, conversations can be cleared, but knowledge persists

**This is the foundation of durable multi-agent systems.**

### Test: Create a New Memory While Context is Managed

Let's verify that new memory operations work fine after clearing.

**1. In any chat window, type:**

```
I'm David from FinTech Solutions. We need help with a data analytics project. Budget is $800K, timeline is 12 months, must handle 10TB of data with real-time processing.
```

**2. Press Enter and watch**

**Expected result**:
- Claude creates a new memory file (memory_david.md or similar)
- Token counts continue to update normally
- If you're over the threshold again, another clearing might trigger

**What this proves**: Context Management doesn't interfere with normal operations. Memory creation, reading, and updating continue to work perfectly.

### Understand What Gets Cleared vs. Preserved

This is crucial to understand. Let's break it down:

**What GETS CLEARED (Temporary Scaffolding):**
- Old tool use requests: `{"type": "tool_use", "input": {...}}`
- Old tool results: `{"type": "tool_result", "content": "{...}"}`
- These are replaced with placeholders like: `[This tool call was removed to manage context size]`

**What STAYS IN CONTEXT:**
- System prompt (always needed)
- User messages (semantic content)
- Assistant responses (the actual text, not tool internals)
- Recent tool uses (configurable - we set it to 0 for demo)
- Conversation flow and structure

**What's PRESERVED EXTERNALLY:**
- ALL memory files (they're not in context, they're in storage)
- File contents never change from clearing
- Can be read anytime by any agent

**The analogy**: Think of context like your working memory (limited capacity) and memory files like your filing cabinet (unlimited storage, persistent).

### Understanding the Benefits

Let's recap what you've learned and why it matters:

**Benefit 1: Persistent Knowledge**
- Memory files survive forever, independent of context
- Users can share knowledge without passing full context
- System can restart without losing information

**Benefit 2: Automatic Token Management**
- No manual intervention needed
- System intelligently decides what to clear
- You configure once, it runs forever

**Benefit 3: Measurable Cost Savings**
- See exact tokens saved in real-time
- 50-80% reduction in token usage for multi-agent systems
- Scales linearly instead of exponentially

**Benefit 4: Smart Separation**
- Semantic content (what matters) vs. scaffolding (how it was done)
- Knowledge preserved, overhead cleared
- Best of both worlds

**Benefit 5: Infinite Conversations**
- No practical limit on conversation length
- Multi-agent pipelines can run indefinitely
- Complex workflows become feasible

### The Production-Ready Architecture

What you've built is a simplified version of real production patterns:

**Your demo**: Discovery ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí Proposal (3 users)

**Production examples**:
- **Customer service**: Triage ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Resolution ‚Üí Escalation ‚Üí Follow-up
- **Software development**: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
- **Research**: Search ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Synthesize ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Report
- **Sales**: Lead qualification ‚Üí Discovery ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Proposal ‚Üí Negotiation ‚Üí Close

**Each user/chat context**:
- Provides role context through their messages
- Claude reads memory to understand full context
- Claude performs the requested task
- Claude writes results to memory for other users
- Operates independently (can be scaled, replaced, or restarted)

**Note**: In production, you might use specialized system prompts per agent for more consistent behavior. This tutorial uses a single shared system prompt to keep setup simple while demonstrating the core concepts.

**The system**:
- Manages token overhead automatically
- Provides observability (statistics, logging)
- Scales horizontally (add more agents without exponential cost)
- Is production-ready (this tutorial uses the same patterns as enterprise systems)

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Memory files aren't being created

**Symptoms**: Claude responds but no "üîß Memory Tool" boxes appear

**Solution**: Try prompting more explicitly:
```
Please save this information to memory: [your content]
```

Claude decides when to use memory based on content. Explicitly asking helps during learning.

### Problem: Context clearing isn't triggering

**Symptoms**: "‚è≥ No clearing yet" persists after many messages

**Solutions**:
1. Check that "Enable Context Management" is checked
2. Verify trigger threshold is set to 2,000 (not 10,000 or higher)
3. Try memory-heavy operations: "Show me all memories in the system" (repeat 3-4 times)
4. Check the input token count - if it's under 2,000, keep adding interactions

**Why**: Token counts vary based on Claude's responses. Memory view operations are particularly token-heavy.

### Problem: Statistics aren't updating after clearing

**Symptoms**: Clearing message appears but statistics show zero

**Solution**:
1. Refresh the browser page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. Check the statistics expandable section again
3. If still not updating, restart the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running Streamlit
   streamlit run dual_chat_streamlit.py
   ```

### Problem: AWS Bedrock connection errors

**Symptoms**: "Failed to initialize Bedrock client" or timeout errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify AWS credentials are configured: `aws configure list`
2. Check you have Bedrock access: `aws bedrock list-foundation-models --region us-east-1`
3. Verify your IAM user has the `bedrock:InvokeModel` permission
4. Try switching to a different AWS region in the code (search for "us-east-1" and try "us-west-2")

### Problem: Claude isn't reading memory from another chat

**Symptoms**: Chat 2 or 3 says it doesn't have information that Chat 1 stored

**Solutions**:
1. Check that memory files actually exist in the "üìÅ Memory Files" section
2. Try prompting more explicitly: "Please check memory files for information about Alice"
3. Verify the system prompt includes the memory protocol (should be default)
4. Watch for the `view` command in the "üîß Memory Tool" boxes

### Problem: Streamlit app crashes or becomes unresponsive

**Symptoms**: Page stops responding or shows errors

**Solutions**:
1. Check the terminal running Streamlit for error messages
2. Restart the app: Ctrl+C in terminal, then `streamlit run dual_chat_streamlit.py`
3. Clear your browser cache and reload
4. Check system resources (memory, CPU) - multiple Claude calls can be intensive

## Conclusion

You've just learned one of the most powerful patterns in modern AI: multi-agent systems with persistent memory and automatic context management.

This isn't just a demo - it's the architecture pattern used in production systems that:
- Handle thousands of conversations daily
- Coordinate dozens of specialized agents
- Run indefinitely without hitting context limits
- Scale cost-effectively

The key insights you now understand:
1. **Memory files** enable knowledge sharing across agents and time
2. **Context management** prevents exponential growth of conversation history
3. **Separation of concerns** between working memory and persistent storage
4. **Automatic optimization** makes the system production-ready without manual intervention

You're now ready to build sophisticated agentic systems that actually work in production. Start with a simple pipeline like you built here, then expand it as you learn more.

**Welcome to the future of AI applications!**
