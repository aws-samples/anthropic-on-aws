# ACME Corp. Cloud Migration Project Requirements

## Demo Scenario Overview
This document outlines the requirements for our cloud migration project.

---

## 1. Current Infrastructure

**What we're migrating from:**
- On-premises data center with aging hardware (8+ years old)
- Mix of physical servers and VMware virtualization
- Legacy monolithic applications running on Windows Server 2012 R2 and RHEL 7
- Traditional three-tier architecture with web, application, and database layers
- On-premises SQL Server 2014 databases

---

## 2. Target Cloud Platform

**Preferred provider:** AWS

**Rationale:**
- Existing enterprise agreement in place
- Team has foundational AWS knowledge
- Strong regional presence in our target markets

---

## 3. Scale & Scope

**Workload types:**
- 3 customer-facing web applications
- 2 internal business applications
- 1 data analytics platform
- File storage and backup systems

**Data volume:**
- Approximately 15 TB of structured data
- 25 TB of unstructured data (files, backups, archives)

**Application count:**
- 5 primary applications
- 12 supporting microservices
- 8 databases

---

## 4. Key Objectives

**Primary goals (in priority order):**
1. **Cost optimization** - Reduce infrastructure costs by 30-40%
2. **Scalability** - Handle 3x traffic spikes during peak seasons
3. **Business continuity** - Achieve 99.9% uptime with automated disaster recovery
4. **Modernization** - Refactor key applications to cloud-native architecture
5. **Security** - Improve security posture and compliance readiness

---

## 5. Timeline

**Target completion:** 9 months from project kickoff

**Key milestones:**
- Month 1-2: Assessment and planning
- Month 3-5: Pilot migration (non-production environments)
- Month 6-8: Production migration (phased approach)
- Month 9: Optimization and knowledge transfer

---

## 6. Current Challenges

**Key concerns and blockers:**

- **Downtime constraints** - Customer-facing apps require <4 hours maintenance window
- **Compliance** - Must maintain SOC 2 compliance throughout migration
- **Data dependencies** - Complex interdependencies between legacy applications
- **Skills gap** - Limited cloud expertise within current IT team (training needed)
- **Budget constraints** - Migration must fit within approved capital budget
- **Legacy architecture** - Some applications tightly coupled to on-premises infrastructure

---

## Success Criteria

- Zero data loss during migration
- Minimal business disruption (<8 hours total downtime across all applications)
- Cost savings realized within 12 months post-migration
- All applications meeting or exceeding current performance benchmarks
- Team trained and capable of managing cloud infrastructure independently
