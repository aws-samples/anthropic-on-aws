# Claude 3.5 Streamlit Multimodal LLM Playground

## Overview

This repository contains a Streamlit-based application for interacting with Claude 3 and 3.5, a powerful language model developed by Anthropic. The application provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the capabilities of Claude 3, supporting both text-only and image+text inputs, custom system prompts, and tool usage (function calling).

## Application Versions

We offer two versions of this application, each tailored to different deployment scenarios:

1. [Anthropic API Version](/claude-multimodal-llm-playground/anthropic/README.md)
2. [Amazon Bedrock Version](/claude-multimodal-llm-playground/bedrock/README.md)

### Anthropic API Version

This version interacts directly with the Anthropic API. It's suitable for users who have an Anthropic API key and want to use Claude 3 models without additional cloud infrastructure.

### Amazon Bedrock Version

This version is designed to work with Claude 3 and 3.5 models through Amazon Bedrock. It's ideal for users who prefer to leverage AWS infrastructure or have existing workflows in the AWS ecosystem.
